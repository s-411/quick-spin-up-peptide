# Archive

This directory preserves historical planning documents and legacy documentation that have been superseded by the consolidated design-system guides under `docs/`.

- Files inside `archive/docs/` reflect earlier narrative documentation. They are retained for context only.
- Files inside `archive/plans/` capture previous tier plans and completion notes.
- Files inside `archive/design-system/` are the legacy setup guides that informed the new consolidated documentation.

Do not modify these files during day-to-day work; instead, update the living documents in `docs/`.
