# Feature Specification: Canvas Layouts Showcase Page

**Feature Branch**: `002-canvas-layouts-page`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The spec will be called canvas and the outcome is to have a link in the top menu called canvas, which links to a new page, which is a direct replica of the page that already exists in the demo-app/app/canvas/page.tsx. We want to recreate that page exactly in both light and dark mode in our starter app as a standalone page."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Canvas Showcase via Navigation (Priority: P1)

As a developer or designer, I want to access the Canvas layouts showcase page through a navigation link so that I can quickly browse and reference available layout components for my project.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for the entire feature - without navigation access, the page cannot be reached. This delivers immediate value by making the showcase discoverable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking the "Canvas" link in the navigation menu and verifying that the page loads successfully. Delivers value by providing immediate access to the layout gallery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on any page in the starter app, **When** I look at the top navigation menu, **Then** I see a "Canvas" link displayed
2. **Given** I am on any page in the starter app, **When** I click the "Canvas" navigation link, **Then** I am taken to the Canvas layouts showcase page at `/canvas`
3. **Given** I am on the Canvas page, **When** I check the URL, **Then** it shows `/canvas` route

### User Story 2 - Browse Layout Component Variants (Priority: P1)

As a developer building pages, I want to browse all available layout component variants (Hero and Content layouts) so that I can understand what layout options are available and how they look in practice.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the Canvas page - showcasing the 13 layout variants (6 Hero + 7 Content). Without this, the page serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to `/canvas` and verifying all 13 layout components are visible and properly rendered. Delivers value by providing a complete visual reference of available layouts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the Canvas page, **When** I scroll through the page, **Then** I see all 6 Hero layout variants displayed (Hero01 through Hero06)
2. **Given** I am on the Canvas page, **When** I continue scrolling, **Then** I see all 7 Content layout variants displayed (Content01 through Content07)
3. **Given** I view each layout component, **When** I examine the visual presentation, **Then** each component matches the design system styling exactly as shown in the demo-app version
4. **Given** I view the layouts, **When** I look at spacing and typography, **Then** they follow the design system specifications

### User Story 3 - Theme Support for Layout Preview (Priority: P2)

As a designer checking layout appearance, I want to view all layout components in both light and dark modes so that I can ensure they work correctly in all theme contexts.

**Why this priority**: Theme support is essential for a modern application but is secondary to having the page exist and display the layouts. This enhances the showcase but isn't required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling between light and dark themes on the Canvas page and verifying all layouts render correctly in both modes. Delivers value by ensuring theme compatibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the Canvas page in light mode, **When** I toggle to dark mode using the theme switcher, **Then** all layout components update to display dark mode styling
2. **Given** I am on the Canvas page in dark mode, **When** I toggle to light mode, **Then** all layout components update to display light mode styling
3. **Given** I switch themes, **When** the transition occurs, **Then** there are no visual glitches or layout shifts
4. **Given** I view any layout in either theme, **When** I examine colors and contrast, **Then** they follow the design system theme tokens

---

### User Story 4 - Interact with Layout Components (Priority: P3)

As a developer testing layouts, I want interactive elements (buttons, links) within layout components to be functional so that I can see how they behave in a real context.

**Why this priority**: Interactive functionality is nice-to-have for demonstration purposes but not critical. The primary value is visual reference, not full interactivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking buttons and links within the layout components and verifying they respond appropriately. Delivers enhanced demonstration value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing a Hero layout with CTA buttons, **When** I hover over the buttons, **Then** they show hover states as defined in the design system
2. **Given** I am viewing a Content layout with interactive elements, **When** I interact with them, **Then** they respond with appropriate visual feedback

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Canvas page is accessed on mobile devices with smaller viewports?
- How does the page handle very long layout component content that might overflow?
- What happens if theme preference is not set (system default should apply)?
- How does the page perform with all 13 layout components loaded simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST add a "Canvas" navigation link to the top menu/header component
- **FR-002**: System MUST create a new route at `/canvas` in the starter-app
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all 6 Hero layout variants (Hero01, Hero02, Hero03, Hero04, Hero05, Hero06) on the Canvas page
- **FR-004**: System MUST display all 7 Content layout variants (Content01, Content02, Content03, Content04, Content05, Content06, Content07) on the Canvas page
- **FR-005**: System MUST render all layout components using the same design system styling as the demo-app version
- **FR-006**: System MUST support theme switching between light and dark modes on the Canvas page
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy across all displayed layouts
- **FR-008**: Canvas page MUST be accessible via direct URL navigation to `/canvas`
- **FR-009**: System MUST render the Canvas page using the same layout wrapper/structure as other pages in starter-app
- **FR-010**: Navigation link MUST be visible on all pages in the starter-app
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve all interactive functionality from the original demo-app Canvas page (hover states, button interactions)
- **FR-012**: System MUST use the identical component implementations from demo-app (no modifications to layout component logic)
- **FR-013**: Canvas page MUST load and render performantly with all 13 components visible
- **FR-014**: System MUST apply the correct CSS custom properties and design tokens to all layout components

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Canvas Page Route**: Next.js app router page at `/canvas` that serves as the container for all layout showcase components
- **Hero Layout Components**: 6 pre-built hero section variants (Hero01-Hero06) imported from design-system or demo-app
- **Content Layout Components**: 7 pre-built content section variants (Content01-Content07) imported from design-system or demo-app
- **Navigation Menu**: Existing navigation component that needs a new "Canvas" link added

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Canvas page loads successfully at `/canvas` route with all 13 layout components visible
- **SC-002**: Navigation link for "Canvas" is visible in the header and navigates correctly to `/canvas` when clicked
- **SC-003**: All layout components render identically to the demo-app/app/canvas/page.tsx version (visual regression testing confirms 100% match)
- **SC-004**: Theme toggle switches all layout components between light and dark modes without errors or visual glitches
- **SC-005**: Canvas page passes accessibility audit with no critical issues (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- **SC-006**: Canvas page loads in under 2 seconds on standard broadband connection
- **SC-007**: All interactive elements (buttons, hover states) function correctly and match design system specifications

## Assumptions

- The layout components (Hero01-Hero06, Content01-Content07) already exist in the demo-app and can be imported/reused in starter-app
- The design system styles are already integrated in starter-app (from previous work)
- The navigation component exists and can be modified to add a new link
- The ThemeProvider is already set up and functional in starter-app
- No modifications to the layout component logic are required - they can be used as-is

## Dependencies

- Design system styles must be properly integrated in starter-app (already completed)
- ThemeProvider component must be functional (already exists in starter-app)
- Navigation/header component must exist and be editable
- Layout component files must be accessible from demo-app for import/copy

## Out of Scope

- Creating new layout variants beyond the existing 13 components
- Modifying or enhancing the existing layout components
- Adding filtering, search, or categorization of layouts
- Creating a layout editor or customization tool
- Adding code snippets or implementation examples for each layout
- Creating documentation beyond the visual showcase
- Adding analytics or tracking for Canvas page usage
- Implementing layout export or download functionality
