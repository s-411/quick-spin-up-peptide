# Feature Specification: Starter App Template Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `001-starter-app-template`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Building a Next.js starter app template that includes all common integrations (Supabase for auth/db, Stripe for payments, Resend for emails, multiple marketing email providers, dark/light themes, RAG Q&A chatbot) ready to use with just environment variables. Goal is to create a reusable template that cuts 60-70% of work for building multiple apps by having all infrastructure pre-wired but not too deeply customized."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Bootstraps New Project (Priority: P1)

A developer clones the template repository and can have a fully functional application running locally within 15 minutes by only adding environment variables.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - developers need to go from zero to functioning app quickly to justify using the template.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by cloning the repo, copying .env.example to .env.local, adding valid API keys, and running the development server.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh clone of the template repo, **When** developer copies .env.example and adds valid API keys, **Then** the application starts without errors
2. **Given** environment variables are configured, **When** developer runs the setup command, **Then** all integrations connect successfully and show green status
3. **Given** the template is running locally, **When** developer navigates to the app, **Then** they see a functional landing page with working auth, theme toggle, and payment flow

---

### User Story 2 - Authentication Flow Setup (Priority: P2)

A developer can enable user authentication immediately with sign up, sign in, password reset, and profile management working out of the box.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is foundational for most SaaS apps and having it pre-configured saves significant development time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by signing up a new user, logging in, resetting password, and accessing protected routes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the auth system is configured, **When** a new user signs up with email, **Then** account is created and confirmation email is sent
2. **Given** a registered user, **When** they sign in with correct credentials, **Then** they access their dashboard
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they visit a protected route, **Then** they can access it without re-authenticating
4. **Given** a user forgot their password, **When** they request a reset, **Then** they receive a reset link via email

---

### User Story 3 - Payment Integration Ready (Priority: P2)

A developer can immediately accept payments with pre-configured checkout flows, subscription management, and webhook handling.

**Why this priority**: Payment processing is complex to set up correctly; having it pre-wired with proper security saves weeks of development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating a test payment, completing checkout, and verifying webhook receipt.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Stripe is configured with test keys, **When** user clicks subscribe, **Then** they're redirected to a working checkout page
2. **Given** a successful payment, **When** webhook is received, **Then** user account is upgraded to paid status
3. **Given** an active subscription, **When** user accesses billing page, **Then** they can manage their subscription

---

### User Story 4 - Email Communications Setup (Priority: P3)

A developer has both transactional and marketing email systems ready to use for user communications.

**Why this priority**: Email infrastructure is essential for user engagement but can be configured after core functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering transactional emails and setting up a marketing campaign.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Resend is configured, **When** a transactional event occurs, **Then** appropriate email is sent within 5 seconds
2. **Given** marketing platform is connected, **When** user signs up, **Then** they're added to the appropriate mailing list
3. **Given** email templates exist, **When** developer needs to customize, **Then** they can modify without changing integration code

---

### User Story 5 - Theme and UI Customization (Priority: P3)

A developer can customize the look and feel of the application with pre-built theme switching and responsive layouts.

**Why this priority**: While important for user experience, theming can be added after core functionality is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling themes, checking responsive breakpoints, and customizing design tokens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the theme system is active, **When** user toggles dark/light mode, **Then** entire app updates consistently
2. **Given** responsive layouts, **When** viewed on mobile device, **Then** navigation collapses to mobile menu
3. **Given** design system tokens, **When** developer changes primary color, **Then** all components reflect the change

### Edge Cases

- What happens when environment variables are missing or invalid?
- How does system handle API service outages (Supabase, Stripe, email providers)?
- What occurs when switching between test and production environments?
- How are API rate limits handled across different services?
- What happens during concurrent user sessions with the same account?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-004**: System MUST handle both test and production environment configurations
- **FR-005**: Template MUST include pre-configured payment processing with subscription support
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide both transactional and marketing email capabilities
- **FR-007**: Template MUST support theme switching between dark and light modes with persistence
- **FR-008**: System MUST be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-009**: Template MUST include user settings/profile management interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide webhook endpoints for payment and email events
- **FR-011**: Template MUST include error handling and user-friendly error messages

## Assumptions

- Using industry-standard session-based authentication with JWT tokens
- Stripe will be the primary and only payment processor with standard subscription tiers
- Email retention follows standard practices (transactional: 30 days, marketing: until unsubscribe)
- Default to REST API patterns for service integrations
- Error messages will be user-friendly with fallback to generic messages for security
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- RAG Q&A chatbot will use vector embeddings with document upload, chunking, and retrieval
- Marketing email providers (ConvertKit, MailerLite, Brevo, Sender) use lightweight adapter pattern
- Email provider switching requires only environment variable changes, no code modifications
